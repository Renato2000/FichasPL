Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> ABin
Rule 1     ABin -> ( num ABin ABin )
Rule 2     ABin -> ( )

Terminals, with rules where they appear

(                    : 1 2
)                    : 1 2
error                : 
num                  : 1

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

ABin                 : 1 1 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . ABin
    (1) ABin -> . ( num ABin ABin )

state 3

    (1) ABin -> ( num . ABin ABin )
    (1) ABin -> . ( num ABin ABin )
    (2) ABin -> . ( )
